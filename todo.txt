-find decent way to cluster river hands
-find state space abstraction beyond hands, handle continuous bets both for states and actions, possibly if player stack goes to 0 the player loses, this would allow for a easy discretisation in the state representation given by needed_bet / player_stack between [0, 1]
-possibly one big cmake to handle everything ??
-clean plots file, still to understand why mds yields wrong results with clustering
-representation and definition of state
-how to deal with raises
-check recursive function to play poker hands
-implement cfr and variants
-check depth limited search for imperfect information games
-function that takes a strategy map<state_representation, distribution_over_actions> and computes exploitability !!
